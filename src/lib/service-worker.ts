/**
 * Section 41.14 rules 9 and 11 - the page's side of the service worker
 * (public/sw.js): registering it, and knowing when a new release is
 * waiting.
 *
 *   const { updateReady, reload } = useServiceWorker()
 *
 * PHONE ONLY. The installable app is the phone's (41.12, 41.19 rule 1),
 * so the worker is registered only in the phone layout (useLayout(),
 * 41.2), only in a production build (in development every file changes on
 * every save, and a cached one would fight the dev server), and only in a
 * secure context (https, or localhost), the only place a browser allows
 * one. On a computer nothing is registered and `updateReady` is always
 * false, so desktop behaves exactly as it did. A foldable that unfolds
 * keeps a worker it already has; it is never unregistered, because that
 * would also drop the phone's notification subscription (lib/push.ts).
 *
 * WHICH RELEASE IS THIS? The offline screen (/offline) is prerendered at
 * build time and names the build's hashed files, so its HTML changes
 * exactly when a new release is deployed. A short hash of it, as the
 * server sends it now, is the release's name: no version for anyone to
 * remember to bump. It is read when the page opens (the release THIS page
 * belongs to, since page HTML is never cached) and again later, to see
 * whether the server has moved on while the page stayed open.
 *
 * THE WORKER is registered as /sw.js?release=<name>. A new release is a
 * new script address, which the browser installs as a new worker; it
 * caches the new offline screen and waits (public/sw.js).
 *
 *   - A waiting worker of a NEWER release than the page: `updateReady`.
 *     The new-version banner offers "Reload" (connection-banner.tsx).
 *   - A waiting worker of the page's OWN release (the page opened after
 *     the release went out, while the old worker still ran): the page is
 *     not old, so the worker is told to take over quietly, with no banner.
 *   - The first worker on a phone takes over by itself: nothing waits.
 *
 * WHEN IT LOOKS. When the page opens, when the app comes back to the
 * front (at most every 5 minutes), and every 30 minutes while it is in
 * front. Each look is one small request for /offline; each registration
 * also lets the browser check sw.js and sw-push.js for changes.
 *
 * `reload()` asks the waiting worker to take over (SKIP_WAITING) and
 * reloads once it controls the page, so the reloaded page and the worker
 * are the same release. A worker that has not taken over within 3 seconds
 * does not leave the button dead: the page reloads anyway, and the fresh
 * page settles the worker quietly as above.
 *
 * A PRODUCT KEEPS /offline (app/offline/page.tsx). Without it there is
 * nothing to cache for the offline screen and nothing to name a release
 * by, so no worker is registered.
 */

/*
 * PORT NOTE: development. The kit registers only in a production build. Here
 * the worker is registered under `next dev` too, as /sw.js?dev=1, so phone
 * notifications can be tested locally; in that mode public/sw.js caches
 * nothing and answers no request (SHELL_DEV there), so it can never serve a
 * stale dev chunk or page. Releases are not tracked in development (no
 * offline screen is built), so no new-version banner either.
