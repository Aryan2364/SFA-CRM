/**
 * Section 17: free-form text spans all 12 columns, so a textarea is the
 * one field that is allowed to be full width. Everything else about it
 * matches Input.
 *
 * ON PHONE (41.7 rule 11) a long-text field grows as the person types and
 * never scrolls inside itself; the page scrolls (section 1 rule 8). Two
 * things do it:
 *
 *   - field-sizing: content, which the field already carries in both
 *     layouts, grows it with its text where the browser has it (Chrome,
 *     and so Android's browsers).
 *   - Where the browser does not (Safari on the iPhones the kit
 *     supports, at the time of writing), a fallback sets the field's height to its text's height on every
 *     change. It runs only in the phone layout and only when the browser
 *     lacks field-sizing, so nothing changes on the computer. The height
 *     is a runtime measurement of the text, not a spacing choice
 *     (section 1 rule 2).
 *
 * `phone:overflow-y-hidden` keeps it from ever scrolling inside itself,
 * and `phone:max-h-none` lifts any cap a caller set for the computer, so
 * a cap can never bring that inner scroll back on phone. It is full
 * width already (w-full), and the 480px field cap never applied to it.
