/**
 * Section 41.7 rules 13 and 14: the banner at the top of a phone form
 * whose draft (lib/drafts.ts) was found when it opened. Place it first in
 * the form, above the fields. It draws nothing while useDraft has nothing
 * to offer, which is always on the computer.
 *
 *   <DraftBanner draft={draft} onUse={(kept) => setValues({ ...values, ...kept })} />
 *
 * Two forms, both neutral one-line banners (section 7.5), built from
 * banner.tsx so they take its phone form (41.8 rule 15):
 *
 *   - THE OFFER (rule 13): "You have an unsaved draft from 3:45 PM.",
 *     with "Use draft" and "Discard", and NO close button: the person
 *     chooses one. The banner is the one place on the form that holds
 *     two actions, as rule 13 sets out; both are secondary, because the
 *     form's one primary action is Save (6.1 rule 1).
 *   - NOT USED (rule 14): "Your draft from 3:45 PM was not used, because
 *     Suresh Patel changed this record at 4:10 PM." It reports, so it
 *     closes like any banner (7.5 rule 3), and closing it deletes the
 *     draft. It has no action: there is nothing left to do with the
 *     draft.
 *
 * TIMES (section 18). A time on the same day reads "3:45 PM" (h:mm A).
 * One from another day reads as the full date and time, "12 Aug 2026,
 * 3:45 PM", because a time alone would be a different moment.
 *
 * The draft banner counts toward a page's one banner (7.5 rule 5). The
 * words are English defaults; a product in another language passes
 * `text` from its strings file (37.6).
