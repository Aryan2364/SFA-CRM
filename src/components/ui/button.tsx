/**
 * Section 6.
 * Four levels: primary, secondary, ghost, danger, plus `in-field`.
 * Exactly one primary button per screen or per dialog; everything
 * else is secondary. Ghost is allowed only for icon-only buttons
 * inside a toolbar, which is why it still carries a fill and a
 * border - a button the user cannot see is a button is broken.
 *
 * `in-field` is section 6.3.1: an icon button INSIDE an input, a
 * select or any other bordered field. It is the one variant with no
 * fill and no border, because the field around it already is the
 * visible container and a bordered button inside a bordered input
 * draws a box inside a box. It is NOT a general-purpose quiet button
 * - used anywhere else it is exactly the invisible control section
 * 6.1 rule 4 forbids. Same shape as the calendar day cell: a control
 * nested inside another container does not bring its own border.
 *
 * Height is fixed at 36 / 32 / 40. Width grows with the label,
 * height never does, so two buttons on different screens are always
 * the same height.
