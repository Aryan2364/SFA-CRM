/**
 * Section 6.
 * Four levels: primary, secondary, ghost, danger, plus `in-field` and
 * `on-brand`.
 * Exactly one primary button per screen or per dialog; every other
 * button with a text label is secondary, and carries the brand in its
 * text and icon (primary-text) so the one filled primary still stands
 * out (6.1 rule 2).
 *
 * `ghost` is the quiet icon-only button of section 6.3, everywhere: no
 * fill and no border at rest. Its icon, tooltip, hover fill and focus
 * ring make it readable as a control (6.1 rule 4). It is for icon-only
 * buttons ONLY - a text label on it is the word-with-no-edge that 6.1
 * rule 5 forbids.
 *
 * `in-field` is section 6.3.1: the same quiet button INSIDE an input, a
 * select or any other bordered field, with its focus ring inset so the
 * field does not clip it.
 *
 * `on-brand` is section 6.3.2: the same quiet button ON a section 36
 * header band, its colours reversed for the brand ground. With a text
 * label (a text size) it also draws a 1px on-brand-muted border, so a
 * word on the band still has a visible edge (6.1 rule 5) - see
 * compoundVariants.
 *
 * Height is fixed at 36 / 32 / 40. Width grows with the label,
 * height never does, so two buttons on different screens are always
 * the same height. On a touch screen `tap-area` grows the TAP area to
 * 44px without changing what the user sees (9 rule 4). In the phone
 * layout all three sizes are 44px visibly (41.9 rule 2); that is a token
 * value in globals.css, not a class here (41.9 rule 3).
 *
 * `loading` is section 14 rule 2's one loading state - disabled, aria-busy,
 * "Saving" (or the caller's words), at an unchanged width. No screen builds its own.

     * utility `outline-2` to `outline-style: var(--tw-outline-style);
     * outline-width: 2px`. Both land on this element, so the width
     * utility reads the style back out of the variable the suppressor
     * just set: the focus ring computes to 2px of `outline-style: none`
     * and paints nothing, while `:focus-visible` matches and every
     * class reads correctly in the markup. It is invisible in the one
     * place it cannot afford to be, and invisible in review too.
     *
     * `focus-visible:[outline-style:solid]` sets the property directly.
     * The tidy `focus-visible:outline-solid` compiles to the same CSS
     * but does NOT survive `cn()`: tailwind-merge groups it with the
     * outline-COLOUR utilities and drops
     * `focus-visible:outline-primary-ring`, which leaves a correct ring
     * in `currentColor`. Measured both ways.

     * them carries this third class. Anything added later does too.

/**

 * Popover, Menu, Sheet, Dialog, AlertDialog, and this kit's own
 * `AlertDialogCancel` - ends up in Base UI's `evaluateRenderProp`,
 * which does `cloneElement(render, {...props, ref})`.
 *
 *   React 19: `ref` is an ordinary prop on a function component, so the
 *             spread below would carry it through even without this.
 *   React 18: `ref` is a RESERVED key on the element. A function
 *             component never receives it, the ref resolves to null,
 *             and React warns "Function components cannot be given
 *             refs".
 *
 * What a null ref costs is not a crash, which is why it survived so
 * long: the popup still MOUNTS. It just has no anchor element to
 * position against, so Base UI's positioner pins it at top:0 left:0
 * with opacity:0 - invisible, while `aria-expanded` says "true". The
 * tooltip does not appear at all, and dialogs mount without moving
 * focus into themselves. Measured on React 18.3.1 before this ref
 * existed; see `_kit-only/react-compat-harness`.
 *
 * The declared element type is `HTMLButtonElement` because that is what
 * this renders by default. A caller using `render` to become something
 * else (`render={<Link/>}`) narrows it at the call site.
