/**
 * Section 21, made into a component so no screen has to remember it.
 *
 * Recharts draws the bars. Every decision section 21 makes is taken
 * here rather than at the call site, because a chart palette chosen
 * per screen is how a red bar ends up meaning "third quarter".
 *
 *   - THE CATEGORICAL SEQUENCE, IN ORDER. Series 1 is the brand
 *     colour and series 2 is ochre, which are maximally different
 *     because most charts have only two or three series. The caller
 *     names its series; it never names a colour.
 *   - NEVER THE STATUS COLOURS. They are not in the list below, so a
 *     caller cannot reach one. A chart that is genuinely about status
 *     is a different component and does not exist yet.
 *   - MAXIMUM SIX SERIES. Past that, group the smallest into "Other".
 *     This throws rather than drawing a seventh colour nobody chose.
 *   - BARS START AT ZERO. Not a default that a later prop can
 *     override — the domain is fixed here.
 *   - DIRECT LABELS, NOT A LEGEND. Every bar carries its own value at
 *     its end, so the eye never travels to a key and back. The series
 *     names sit beside the chart as a short key, which is next to the
 *     bars rather than across the card from them.
 *
 * HORIZONTAL BARS on purpose. A category label is usually a name and
 * an amount is usually long; both collide immediately under vertical
 * bars. Sideways, each gets a whole line to itself.
 *
 * The one thing that becomes a JS number is the bar's LENGTH, which is
 * a pixel measurement and cannot be anything else. The label beside it
 * is a string the caller formats, so the digits a person reads never
 * went through a float.
 *
 * NOT `ResponsiveContainer`. The width below is measured by this file
 * and handed to the chart explicitly, for one reason worth stating
 * because it is not obvious: **the first measurement is a
 * `getBoundingClientRect()` on mount and does not wait for the
 * observer to fire.**
 *
 * That matters more than it sounds. A `ResizeObserver` callback is
 * delivered during the browser's rendering steps, and a tab that is
 * not being painted does not run them — in a background tab the
 * observer never fires at all, not even its initial callback. A chart
 * whose only source of width is an observer draws at zero, or at a
 * stale width, in exactly the conditions where nobody is looking to
 * notice, including automated checks run against a background tab.
 * Measuring once directly, then observing for changes, is correct in
 * both.

/**
 * Section 21's categorical sequence, in order. Tokens, never values.
 *
 * Two forms of the same six colours, because an SVG shape and a DOM
 * element are filled by different mechanisms. Neither is a colour: one
 * is a Tailwind class that resolves to `--color-chart-N`, the other is
 * a `var()` reference to the same token. Change the token and both
 * follow, which is the whole point of section 2.1.
 *
 * **The two lists must stay in step.** A swatch needs the class form
 * and a bar needs the `var()` form; there is no single form that
 * reaches both.
