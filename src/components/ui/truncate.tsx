/**
 * Section 8. Text must never overflow its container, and there are
 * three behaviours: truncate, wrap, clamp.
 *
 * Truncate is for table cells, list rows, chips, menu items and
 * buttons. One line ending in three dots, with the full text shown as
 * a tooltip on hover.
 *
 * The tooltip only attaches when the text is actually cut off.
 * Section 19 forbids a tooltip that carries information available
 * nowhere else - so on a string that fits, there is nothing to add and
 * no tooltip appears.
 *
 * ON PHONE THERE IS NO TOOLTIP (41.8 rules 16 to 18), SO THE CALLER OWES
 * THE FULL TEXT A PLACE ONE TAP AWAY. Truncate on phone cuts the text
 * and stops there: it renders no tooltip and never turns into a button.
 * Rule 18 allows two routes for cut text, and both belong to the screen,
 * not to this component:
 *
 *   - clamp to two lines: `phoneLines={2}`. The row name of a phone list
 *     (41.5 rule 9) and a page banner's sentence (41.8 rule 15).
 *   - show in full one tap away: the place the tap already goes. A list
 *     row's supporting facts are "on the record" (41.5 rule 10), which
 *     the whole row opens (41.5 rule 12); a select or multi-select
 *     trigger's value is listed in full in the sheet it opens; an app bar
 *     title or a section tab label (41.4 rules 3 and 21) is the name the
 *     screen below already shows in full (41.6 rule 2).
 *
 * A Truncate whose full text is NOT one tap away on phone is a defect at
 * the call site: use Clamp, or let the text wrap (section 8), instead.
 *
 * Why it does not reveal the text in place on a tap: nearly every phone
 * truncation sits inside something that is already tapped for another
 * purpose - a row that opens a record, a tab, a select trigger - and a
 * second tap target inside it would either steal that tap or be a button
 * inside a button. A control that is a button only when the screen is
 * narrow enough to cut its text would also change role as the phone
 * turns. A screen reader is not short-changed either way: the whole
 * string is in the DOM, only drawn short.
