/**
 * Section 36 - the brand header band.
 *
 * A header band is the chrome that labels the content beneath it: a
 * table's column header, a card header, a dialog, sheet or popover
 * header, a board column header. It is filled with `primary` and takes
 * `on-brand`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A CLASS ON EACH HEADER.
 *
 * Section 36.4: a table inside a card puts two bands within 16px of
 * each other, and two solid bands with a hairline between them read as
 * a rendering fault. The outermost band wins and an inner header drops
 * to the ACCENT FORM - surface fill, `primary-text` label text, a 2px
 * `primary` bottom rule.
 *
 * That resolution is the component's job, never the caller's. Section
 * 24 already records what happens when a structural requirement is
 * left to the call site: three of four dialogs in the first product
 * forgot to wrap their body, which indicts the component rather than
 * the callers. So the nesting is resolved through context, and no call
 * site passes a prop or can get it wrong.
 *
 * The accent form is the FLOOR, not one step in a ladder: level 2 and
 * level 5 look the same. Section 36.4 says so explicitly rather than
 * inventing a third treatment nobody would recognise.

/**
 * How many banded regions deep this point is, COUNTING THE CURRENT
 * region's own band.
 *
 *   0 - not inside any banded region
 *   1 - the outermost band: solid brand fill
 *   2+ - nested: the accent form
 *
 * THE SCOPE IS PUBLISHED BY THE CONTAINER, NOT BY THE BAND, and that
 * is the whole reason this is not three lines of `className`. A band
 * that published to its own children would reach a table nested in the
 * header and nothing else - not the card in a dialog's BODY, which is
 * a sibling of the dialog's header rather than a child of it. Card,
 * Table, DialogContent, SheetContent, PopoverContent and the board
 * column each wrap their whole subtree in `BandScope`, so anything
 * rendered anywhere inside them knows a band is already above it.
