 * Section 13. There are three empty states, not one, and using the
 * wrong one makes the software look unintelligent - never offer "Add
 * your first record" to someone whose filter simply matched nothing.
 *
 * The variant is the whole point of this component, so it is a closed
 * set rather than free-form props. Each variant fixes its own icon and
 * the shape of its action; the caller supplies the words and the
 * handler. A component that can be used wrongly will be.
 *
 *   nothing-yet   - what would normally be here. Primary: create.
 *   nothing-found - the filters matched no records. Clear filters.
 *   failed        - what went wrong. Retry.
 *
 * Each has three parts: a short heading, one line explaining how to
 * change the situation, and one action. Never a blank area, never the
 * words "No data".
