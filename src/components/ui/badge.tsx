 * Section 7.2 rule 1: every status badge carries an icon as well as a
 * colour, because colour alone is invisible to colour-blind users.
 * The caller passes the icon as the first child: STATUS_ICON's, below.
 *
 * `neutral` is section 2.4's fourth status row: Draft, Inactive,
 * Deactivated, Cancelled, Archived - a record that is simply not in use
 * or not started, neither good nor bad. text-secondary on
 * surface-control, about 7.2:1. It is also the default, because a
 * notification is neither success nor failure (7.3).
 *
 * A number inside a control is not a badge: it is Count, below.
