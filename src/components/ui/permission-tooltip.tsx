/**
 * Section 26: **disable** an individual action the user can see but
 * cannot perform, and always say why.
 *
 * The reasoning section 26 gives is that a read-only user sees the same
 * screens with things disabled rather than a separate stripped-down
 * version, so two people looking at one record are looking at the same
 * software. **Somebody who cannot find a button does not know whether
 * it does not exist or whether they cannot use it**, and there is
 * nothing on screen to tell them. A greyed control saying "Only an
 * administrator can delete clients" answers the question the absence
 * leaves open.
 *
 * **Why this wrapper has to exist rather than putting a tooltip on the
 * control:** every disabled control in this system carries
 * `pointer-events-none` — `button` through `disabled:`, the menu items
 * through `data-disabled:`. That is correct, and it also means a
 * disabled control never receives a hover, so a tooltip attached to it
 * can never open. The reason would be written and never readable, and
 * nothing would error: the control looks exactly right, greyed and
 * unclickable and silent.
 *
 * So the hover is caught by a wrapper that is NOT disabled, and the
 * wrapper is focusable, because a keyboard user cannot hover at all and
 * would otherwise be the one person who never learns why (section 19).
 *
 * `allowed` renders the children untouched — no wrapper, no extra
 * element — so the permitted path is exactly what it was before this
 * existed.
