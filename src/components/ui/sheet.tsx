/**
 * Section 41.8: on phone, `<SheetContent side="bottom">` is THE bottom
 * sheet - the one surface that stands in for dialogs, select lists,
 * menus, popovers and the filter panel there. Everything that makes it
 * one lives in this file, so 3B's dialog and 3C's selects, menus and
 * popover get it by rendering a bottom sheet, never by rebuilding it:
 *
 *   - full width, 12px top corners, --shadow-dialog, over --backdrop,
 *     with a drag handle (rules 2 and 3);
 *   - grows with its content to 90% of the visible height less the top
 *     safe area, sits on the keyboard while it is open, and scrolls its
 *     body between a fixed header and footer (rule 4, 24 rule 6);
 *   - closes on a swipe down, the backdrop, Android back and its close
 *     button, every one of them through onOpenChange, so the
 *     unsaved-changes guard can refuse (rule 5, 11.3 rule 10);
 *   - takes focus itself, never a field, so the keyboard stays shut
 *     until a field is tapped (rule 19);
 *   - opens a choice inside itself as a step, with a back arrow, never a
 *     second sheet (rule 9, 24 rule 4) - useSheetStep below.
 *
 * `presentation="screen"` is the other phone layer, what a medium or
 * large dialog becomes (41.8 rule 10): a full-screen layer with the app
 * bar and a back arrow, the body scrolling under it, and the footer as an
 * action bar on the keyboard (41.7 rules 3 and 4, 41.6 rules 7 and 8). It
 * shares the bottom sheet's history entry, its close through onOpenChange
 * and its focus, so Android back, the guard and rule 19 work the same.
 *
 * DESKTOP IS UNTOUCHED. Every difference above is taken only when
 * useLayout() says phone AND the side is bottom (or the presentation is
 * screen). Any other sheet, and every sheet on desktop, renders exactly
 * the markup it did before.

   Opening and closing layers - one queue for the whole document.

   history.go() is asynchronous: its popstate arrives a moment later. A
   layer that closes while another opens in the same tap - a three-dot
   menu item that opens an Edit dialog, the unsaved-changes warning's
   "Leave" closing the warning and the sheet under it - would otherwise
   race. Each pushed or stepped on its own and the closing one's entry
   was left in the history, costing an extra Android back press (41.20
   check 8).

   So no layer touches the history for itself when it opens or closes.
   It asks (requestEntries), and once the commit that opened or closed
   it has run all its effects (a microtask), the queue settles every
   request together against the current entry:

     - the closing layers whose entries are on top are counted down from
       the current entry (kitUnder says what lies beneath without
       stepping there);
     - one closing entry and a layer opening: the entry is REPLACED by
       the new layer's (history.replaceState), so the history never
       holds the closed one at all;
     - closing entries alone: one step back over all of them;
     - more than one closing entry and a layer opening: one step back
       over all of them, and the new layer's entry is pushed once that
       step has landed;
     - nothing closing: the new layer's entry is pushed.

   While a step of ours is still on its way, the queue waits for it to
   land (or to time out) and then settles: an entry pushed before an
   earlier step lands would be the one that step takes away.

   A layer that closes while a layer that opened AFTER it is still open
   leaves its entry under that one. It cannot be removed without
   removing the open one's; lib/back.ts never counts it as a screen.

 * footer (SheetFooter below, 41.8 rule 10) both render. Phone only: its
 * callers render it only in the phone layout.
 *
 *   - Surface, a 1px border-light line on top, 12px (space-3) padding,
 *     plus the bottom and side safe areas (41.13 rule 2). No shadow (5.4
 *     rule 2). While the keyboard is open --safe-bottom is 0px, so the bar
 *     sits directly on it.
 *   - Held sideways the bar stays full width and its buttons keep to the
 *     centred phone column, as the content does (41.13 rule 10).
 *   - At most two buttons, sharing the width (SHARE_THE_WIDTH) in the
 *     order written: the secondary first, on the left, the primary last,
 *     on the right; one takes the full width (rule 8, 11.3 rule 7). More
 *     throws (checkActionBarButtons). A disabled one inside
 *     permission-tooltip.tsx keeps its peer's size (WRAPPED).
 *   - Heights are minimums (41.9 rule 7): a label that wraps at the
 *     largest text size makes its button taller rather than clip, and the
 *     row's buttons stay one height (items-stretch).
 *   - THE BOTTOM-BAR CONTRACT (globals.css): the bar marks itself
 *     data-fixed-bottom="action-bar", and CSS works out --bottom-bar from
 *     that mark with :has, so the content's bottom padding clears the bar
 *     and toasts sit above it (41.8 rule 12) for exactly as long as it is
 *     in the page.
 *
 * `fixed`: fixed to the bottom of the screen, on the shell layer (5.5),
 * sitting on the keyboard (bottom-keyboard-inset: the covered height on
 * iPhone, 0px on Android, where the viewport shrinks instead), and
 * keeping the field being typed in above it (useFieldInView). Otherwise
 * it is the last row of a full-screen layer, which ends at the keyboard
 * and keeps its own fields in view.
 *
 * `className` and any other props go to the row of buttons. `label`
 * names the bar for screen readers (role="group").
