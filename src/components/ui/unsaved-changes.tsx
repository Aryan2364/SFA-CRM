/**
 * Section 11.3 rule 10: leaving a form with unsaved changes asks first.
 *
 *   const unsaved = useUnsavedChanges({ changed: isChanged(values, saved), noun: "client" })
 *   const unsaved = useUnsavedChanges({ changed, noun: "client", mode: isEdit ? "edit" : "create" })
 *   ...
 *   {unsaved.warning}
 *   <Dialog open={open} onOpenChange={unsaved.guard(setOpen, reset)}>
 *
 * While `changed` is true it catches:
 * - in-app navigation: any click on a same-origin link anywhere on the
 *   page (sidebar, breadcrumb, a text link), caught before the router
 *   sees it. Leaving then goes where the link pointed.
 * - closing a dialog or sheet with Escape, the backdrop or the close
 *   button, through `guard(setOpen)` as its onOpenChange.
 * - closing the browser tab or reloading: the browser's own warning,
 *   the one browser dialog the system allows, because no site can style
 *   it.
 *
 * "Changed" is the caller's comparison of current values against the
 * saved ones - isChanged() below - never "was anything typed", so typing
 * and deleting back to the original closes without asking.
 *
 * Two wordings (section 11.3 rule 10):
 * - "edit" (the default): "Leave without saving?", for a record that
 *   already exists and has a Save.
 * - "create": "Leave this invoice?" / "What you have filled in will be
 *   lost." / "Keep filling" / "Leave", for a form whose record does not
 *   exist until it is submitted, so there is nothing to save. The one
 *   Add and Edit form (11.3 rule 1) passes "create" when adding,
 *   including Duplicate; a dialog that records an action (approve,
 *   reassign) is a create form too.
 * The browser's own tab-close warning is the same for both: its words
 * are the browser's.
 *
 * Not caught: the browser's own Back and Forward buttons. The App Router
 * has no hook to cancel them, and a guard that traps Back would be worse
 * than the loss it prevents. On phone that includes Android's back (41.4
 * rule 9); a form there keeps a draft (lib/drafts.ts), so what was typed
 * is offered again rather than lost.
 *
 * A control that leaves the page without being a link - the phone's back
 * arrow, which is the form's Cancel on phone (41.7 rule 3) - carries
 * data-leaves-page and is caught the same way: its click waits for the
 * answer, and Leave clicks it again, unguarded.
 *
 * ON PHONE, LEAVING WAITS FOR THE WARNING TO GO. The warning holds a
 * history entry of its own while open (alert-dialog.tsx, 41.4 rule 9),
 * and closing it steps back off that entry - a step that lands a moment
 * later. Started at once, the back arrow's own step back (or a link's
 * push) raced it, and the person landed two screens back, or off the
 * site. So on phone, Leave closes the warning, waits until it has
 * finished closing (onOpenChangeComplete) and its entry is gone
 * (whenLayersSettled in sheet.tsx), and only then leaves: one screen back
 * from the back arrow, or exactly where the link pointed. Closing a dialog
 * or sheet through `guard` does not wait: the warning and the dialog
 * close together, and the layer queue takes both entries in one step.
 * On desktop nothing has an entry, and Leave leaves at once, as always.
 *
 * ONE ASKS. Several forms on a page may each be changed. The first
 * listener to catch a click asks, and stops every other one hearing it
 * (stopImmediatePropagation), so one leaving press never opens two
 * warnings; and the replayed click of a data-leaves-page control passes
 * every instance (`replaying`, shared by them all), so a second changed
 * form never catches the click the first one let through. Only the asking
 * form's onLeave runs.
 *
 * `onLeave` runs when the person chooses Leave (or "Leave without
 * saving"), by any of the routes above, before they leave. A phone form
 * passes its draft's clear(): choosing Leave discards the draft (41.7
 * rule 15).
