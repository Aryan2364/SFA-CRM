/**
 * Section 33. A list page's optional fifth zone.
 *
 * **Sibling views of ONE SECTION** — three reports over the same data —
 * which is a different job from the `tabs` on a detail page, where the
 * tabs are a record's child collections. Same component underneath;
 * section 33.1 gives the test for which is which: a detail page's tabs
 * are about one RECORD, section tabs are about one SECTION.
 *
 * **Sub-navigation is deliberately rare, and each instance is agreed.**
 * This is a thin wiring layer over `tabs`, not a second tab component
 * and not a licence to add one to every screen. Section 12.1 caps the
 * sidebar at seven items for a reason, and a view is not a destination
 * in its own right — but nor is a tab bar a place to hide a screen that
 * deserves its own sidebar entry.
 *
 * It sits BETWEEN THE HEADER AND THE TOOLBAR and does not scroll. The
 * header names the section and this divides it, so it comes after the
 * title; the toolbar comes after it, because search and filters belong
 * to the active tab rather than to the section. A search box above a
 * tab bar implies it searches all of them, and it does not.
 *
 * The active tab lives in the URL (section 33.4), so a view can be
 * linked to and the browser's own back button returns to the tab the
 * user came from — the navigation this system has instead of a back
 * button (section 1 rule 11). Switching REPLACES the history entry:
 * flipping between three views should not make the back button walk
 * through every flip.
 *
 * **`useSearchParams` requires a Suspense boundary above it** when the
 * page it sits on is prerendered. Render it inside one, or the route
 * opts out of static rendering without saying so.
 *
 * **On phone (41.4 rule 21)** the bar sits directly under the app bar and
 * stays there while the content scrolls beneath it: sticky, at the app
 * bar's height plus the top safe area. Pass it to PageHeader's `tabs`, so
 * it sits under the page's app bar and above the meta line. It runs edge
 * to edge, cancelling the phone content area's side padding (16px plus
 * the side safe areas, 41.4 rule 20, or the wider padding of the centred
 * column held sideways, 41.13 rule 10) and padding back by the safe
 * areas only, so the border-light line spans the screen like the app
 * bar above it. The tabs share the width equally
 * and each label truncates to one line (section 8). The tab height stays
 * fixed: a label that cannot wrap never needs the taller control of 41.9
 * rule 7. The component switches itself through useLayout() and the
 * `phone:` variant (41.3 rule 4); the desktop bar is untouched.
