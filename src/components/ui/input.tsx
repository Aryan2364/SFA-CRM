/**
 * Sections 6.2, 6.4 and 17.
 * Height is fixed at 36px so an input and a button line up on the same
 * row. Width comes from the column it sits in (section 17), capped at
 * 480px because a longer single line is uncomfortable to read back.
 * Validation colours the border danger; the message sits below the
 * field, never in a toast (section 7.1).
