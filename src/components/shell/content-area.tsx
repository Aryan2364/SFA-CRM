/**
 * The phone's content area - 41.4 rule 20, 41.13 rules 2 and 10.
 *
 *   - Sides: 16px (space-4) plus the side safe areas, so nothing sits
 *     under a notch held sideways. No maximum width.
 *   - Held sideways (or on any phone screen wider than the column plus
 *     its 16px sides), the content sits in a centred column no wider than
 *     --spacing-phone-column: each side's padding grows to half of what
 *     is left over. max() picks it only where it is the larger, so an
 *     upright phone, always under 600px wide (41.2 rule 1), keeps 16px.
 *     The app bar, tab bar and action bar stay full width (41.13 rule 10).
 *   - The two side paddings are published as --content-pad-left and
 *     --content-pad-right, so whatever runs FULL WIDTH inside (the page's
 *     app bar, section tabs) bleeds out by exactly them, to the screen's
 *     edges in either orientation.
 *   - Edge-to-edge ROWS (a phone list, More: 41.5 rule 8) are content,
 *     not bars, so held sideways they stay in the column. Their bleed is
 *     published as --content-bleed-left and --content-bleed-right: the
 *     whole padding (16px plus the safe area) where the padding is that,
 *     and 0px where the padding is the sideways column's. CSS has no
 *     "if", so the switch is a clamp: (16px + safe area - column
 *     padding) is >= 0 exactly when max() above picked 16px + safe area,
 *     and scaled by 1000 it saturates to the full 16px + safe area; below
 *     0 it clamps to 0px. It cannot drift from the padding, because it
 *     is built from the same two terms.
 *   - Top: 16px above the first block. A page's app bar pulls itself up
 *     over it (PageHeader).
 *   - Bottom: the bar fixed at the bottom of the screen now, plus the
 *     bottom safe area, plus 16px, so the last block clears the tab bar
 *     or action bar. --bottom-bar is the contract in globals.css, worked
 *     out there by :has from the bar that marks itself in the page
 *     (data-fixed-bottom), never by an effect, so this padding is right
 *     in the server's HTML.
 *   - The page scrolls on the window, never inside this: the tab bar's
 *     scroll to the top (41.4 rule 18) and the sticky app bar and section
 *     tabs rely on it, and an inner scroller would trap the pointer (1
 *     rule 8).
