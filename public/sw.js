/*
 * The kit's service worker - FRONTEND_RULES_PHONE.md section 41.14 rules
 * 9 to 11. Hand-written, no package, no build step. Registered only in
 * the phone layout, in production builds, in a secure context
 * (lib/service-worker.ts): the installable app is the phone's (41.12), so
 * a computer never runs this file and its behaviour is unchanged.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, AND WHAT IT NEVER DOES
 *
 *   - Page HTML is never cached. Pages are dynamic and private (they carry
 *     the signed-in person's data and permissions), so a navigation always
 *     goes to the network. Working fully offline is not built (41.14
 *     rule 8).
 *   - A navigation that FAILS - no connection - or that has not answered
 *     within 8 seconds is answered with the offline screen
 *     (app/offline/page.tsx), cached when this worker installed. So the installed app opens without a connection and shows
 *     the offline banner and the failed empty state with "Try again", never
 *     the browser's error page (41.14 rules 9 and 10, 41.20 check 20). The
 *     address stays the one the person asked for, so "Try again" (a reload)
 *     opens exactly that screen once the connection is back.
 *   - Next's built files (/_next/static/*: scripts, styles, fonts) and the
 *     install icons are kept the first time they are fetched and served
 *     from the cache after that. The built files are content-hashed, so a
 *     cached copy can never be stale: a new release asks for new names.
 *   - Everything else - data requests, RSC payloads, anything not a GET,
 *     other sites - passes straight through, untouched.
 *
 * INSTALL caches the offline screen and the files it needs to draw itself
 * (its styles, scripts and fonts, read from its own HTML), and nothing
 * else: no other page is cached up front. Without its files the screen
 * would paint unstyled on a phone that had not loaded them through this
 * worker yet (the very first visit is loaded before the worker exists).
 *
 * RELEASES AND THE NEW-VERSION BANNER (41.14 rule 11)
 *
 * The worker is registered as /sw.js?release=<id>, where <id> is a hash
 * of the offline screen's HTML as the server sends it now
 * (lib/service-worker.ts). That HTML is prerendered at build time and
 * names the build's hashed files, so it changes exactly when a new release
 * is deployed, with nothing for anyone to remember to bump. A new release
 * means a new script address, which the browser installs as a new worker.
 *
 *   - The new worker installs (caching the new release's offline screen)
 *     and then WAITS: it does not take over the open app by itself.
 *   - The page sees it waiting. If the page is older than it, the page
 *     shows "A new version is ready" with "Reload"; Reload sends
 *     SKIP_WAITING, the new worker takes over, and the page reloads once
 *     it controls the page. If the page is already that release (it was
 *     opened after the release went out), the page sends SKIP_WAITING
 *     quietly: nothing on screen is old.
 *   - On taking over it deletes every older cache of this worker's, and
 *     takes control of the open pages, so their files are cached from now.
 *
 * A change to this file or to /sw-push.js alone is picked up by the
 * browser's own byte-for-byte check (registered with updateViaCache
 * "none") and follows the same path.
 *
 * NAMES. This file shares the worker's global scope with /sw-push.js
 * (part 6C: the push and notificationclick handlers), so every top-level
 * name here starts with SHELL_ and cannot collide with one of its own.
