/*
 * Section 41.12 rules 2 and 3 - phone notifications, inside the service
 * worker. Plain JavaScript, no package, no build step: public/sw.js
 * (part 6B) loads it with importScripts("/sw-push.js").
 *
 * WHAT ARRIVES. The product's backend sends each phone notification as
 * JSON: { title, body, url, tag }.
 *
 *   - title, body: the backend's words, shown as they are. A phone
 *     notification shows on the lock screen, so they never carry amounts
 *     or private details; they name the event: title "Approval waiting",
 *     body "Invoice INV-2041 is waiting for your approval." (41.12 rule 3).
 *     This file adds nothing to them, so it can never add a figure.
 *   - url: the same address the in-app notification opens (41.12 rule 2),
 *     a path on this site: "/invoices/INV-2041". An address on another
 *     site is never opened from a notification; it falls back to "/".
 *   - tag: optional. A later notification with the same tag replaces the
 *     earlier one instead of stacking ("invoice-INV-2041").
 *
 * WHAT A TAP DOES. Closes the notification, then brings the app to the
 * front at `url`: a window already showing that address is focused; else
 * an open window of the app is focused and moved there; else a new window
 * opens. The screen opened this way has no previous screen in the app, so
 * its back arrow goes to its parent (41.4 rule 7).
 *
 * The words, the icon and how a tap behaves are the same in the browser
 * and in the installed app; on iPhone this only ever runs once the app is
 * installed (41.12 rule 5), because only then can the phone subscribe.
